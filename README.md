How can I ensure that my code, program, or software is functional and secure?
One of the most beneficial approaches that I feel someone can take to ensure that their code is functional and meets expectations is creating unbias test cases for the program. Creating these untainted tests ensures that the program is being tested with the ideal use cases and functionality in mind, and not catering to the code written.

How do I interpret user needs and incorporate them into a program?
The most beneficial data I feel that we can utilize are use cases. When it comes to the application, we can be told what features we want within a program, but the same feature can operate differently depending on how the user wants it to be interacted with.

How do I approach designing software?
When it comes to designing software, I find that it is most heplful to create pseudocode and a UML diagram associated with the use cases that I use. Having these simplistic breakdowns of the functionality and expectations makes referring back to the guidelines much easier. With how complex designing code can be, I think that maintaining a simplistic and basic approach where possible helps avoid overbuilding and cluttering code with no benefit to the system or the user.
